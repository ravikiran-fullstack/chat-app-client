1) Context API is used in this project to store contacts, chats.
2) localStorage of the browser is used to persist the contacts and chats data.


3) index.js:1 Warning: findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode. findDOMNode was passed an instance of Transition which is inside StrictMode. 
  Instead, add a ref directly to the element you want to reference. Learn more about using refs safely here: https://reactjs.org/link/strict-mode-find-node

  This above warning can be solved by Removing StrictMode from index.js
    <React.StrictMode>
       <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
    
    But StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants, such as:

    1. Identifying components with unsafe lifecycles
    2. Warning about legacy string ref API usage
    3. Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage
    4. Detecting unexpected side effects
    5. Detecting legacy context API
